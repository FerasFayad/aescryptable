/// Encapsulates errors that may occur during AES encrypt / decrypt operations.

/// - invalidKeySize: The given key `String` count isn't equal to `kCCKeySizeAES256`.
/// - emptyStringToEncrypt: The given `String` to encrypt is empty.
/// - generateRandomIVFailed: Could not generate a random `iv` via `SecRandomCopyBytes(_:_:_:)`.
/// - encryptDataFailed: `CCCryptorStatus` was different than `kCCSuccess` during an encryption operation.
/// - stringToDataFailed: Failed to convert `String` into `Data` via `data(using:allowLossyConversion:)`.
/// - decryptDataFailed: `CCCryptorStatus` was different than `kCCSuccess` during a decryption operation.
/// - dataToStringFailed: Failed to convert `Data` into `String`. E.g.: via `String.init(bytes:encoding:)`.
