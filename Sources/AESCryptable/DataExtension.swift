/// In Swift 5, there are some changes around `withUnsafeBytes(_:)` (and a couple of bugs as a result).
/// For instance, refer to: (forums.swift.org) [use of withunsafebytes](http://bit.ly/withUnsafeBytes).
///
/// This `strutc AES` implementation relies on `UnsafeRawPointer.assumingMemoryBound(to:)` to make
/// `withUnsafeBytes(_:)` to work. This is probably going to change in the next Swift versions.

/// The following `Data extension` aims to abstract some of the complexity around the subject.
